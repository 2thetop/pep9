{"name":"Pep9","tagline":"Pep/9 assembler and simulator for the textbook Computer Systems, J. Stanley Warford, Fifth edition","body":"![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/StanWarford/pep9/master/images/Pep9-icon.png)\r\n#Pep/9#\r\n\r\nPep/9 is a virtual machine for writing machine language and assembly language programs.\r\nIt is designed to be used with the textbook, *Computer Systems*, J. Stanley Warford, Fifth edition, Jones and Bartlett Learning, 20??.\r\nThe goal of the book is to teach the fundamentals of the classic von Neumann machine.\r\nYou should use the Pep/9 system in conjunction with the textbook to write machine language and assembly language programs.\r\n\r\nThis repository is for the source code and platform builds of the Pep/9 simulator and assembler for use with the textbook.\r\nIt is also the home page for the latest information and the Pep/9 CPU simulator.\r\nThe applications are written in C++, are GUI-based, and are compiled with the Qt 5 development environment using the Qt Creator IDE available from Digia Plc. at http://qt-project.org/downloads.\r\n\r\nThe current version of the Pep/9 assembler and simulator is 9.0.0.\r\nSee what's new with this release.\r\n\r\nPlease send comments, bug reports, and feature requests to Stan Warford.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
