<p>Pep/9 is a virtual machine for writing machine language and assembly language programs.
It is designed to be used with the textbook, <em>Computer Systems</em>, J. Stanley Warford, Fifth edition, Jones and Bartlett Learning, 20??.
The goal of the book is to teach the fundamentals of the classic von Neumann machine.
You should use the Pep/9 system in conjunction with the textbook to write machine language and assembly language programs.</p>

<p>This repository is for the source code and platform builds of the Pep/9 simulator and assembler for use with the textbook.
It is also the home page for the latest information and the Pep/9 CPU simulator.
The applications are written in C++, are GUI-based, and are compiled with the Qt 5 development environment using the Qt Creator IDE available from Digia Plc. at <a href="http://qt-project.org/downloads">http://qt-project.org/downloads</a>.</p>

<p>The current version of the Pep/9 assembler and simulator is 9.0.0.
See what's new with this release.</p>
